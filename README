About
=====

Cura-Storage is CIM provider for storage management on Linux.
Currently it has SMI-S like API, Block Devices Package is paritally
implemented. See Documentation below for details.

The provider is written in Python and based on Anaconda installer storage
module. Therefore it is probably usable only on Red Hat based distros,
like Fedora.

BEWARE! The CIM API is not stable at all! SMI-S is still being evaluated.


Installation
============
Tested on Fedora 17.

Prepare software (using sblim here, might be different for Pegasus):
    $ yum install sblim-sfcb cmpi-bindings-pywbem

Install cura-storage somewhere, using /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cura/storage/ here
    $ mkdir /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cura/storage/
    $ cp -r providers/* /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cura/storage/

Register python providers and MOF file (again, sblim specific):
    $ sfcbstage -n root/cimv2 mof/cura-storage.mof
    $ vim mof/cura-storage.sfcb.reg     # change the paths in the file
    $ sfcbstage -r mof/cura-storage.sfcb.reg
    $ sfcbrepos -f

Done! Now just start sfcb as usual:
    $ service sfcb start

Or, for extra debugging output, use sfcbd directly, python "print" command will
write to stdout:
    $ sfcbd


Documentation
=============

CIM API is fully documented in mof/cura-storage.mof and in doc/ subdirectory.
To compile the documentation to readable format install Dia and python-sphinx.

  $ cd doc
  $ make html
