The documentation is generated from running CIMOM, which provides description
of all classes.

Therefore it is necessary:

0) Install PlantUML and Sphinx
   http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/
   http://sphinx-doc.org/

1) Install current MOF files to your CIMCOM running on localhost and start it.
   (or edit generated/Makefile and mof/Makefile and set HOST variable there)

2) run 'make html'
